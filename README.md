<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


User Connector is an app that allows developers (or anyone) to connect with fellow colleagues! A user can create an account, add a profile (which contains info on their work experience, education experience, social media links, email, etc), and begin connecting with others! You can talk to the other users by creating posts, and those users can respond seemlessly by commenting underneath your post.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
